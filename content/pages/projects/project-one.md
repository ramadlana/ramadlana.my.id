The Wireless and Wired Security NAC (Network Access Control) project using Cisco ISE (Identity Services Engine) aims to bolster network security by implementing comprehensive access control measures for both wired and wireless connections. Cisco ISE is a powerful tool that enables organizations to manage and enforce security policies across their entire network infrastructure.

The project involves deploying Cisco ISE to authenticate and authorize users and devices attempting to connect to the network. By leveraging Cisco ISE’s capabilities, the organization can enforce policies based on user roles, device types, and other contextual factors. This ensures that only authorized and compliant devices can access network resources, enhancing overall security.

In addition to user and device authentication, the project includes the implementation of security policies for both wireless and wired connections. This involves configuring VLANs, applying access control lists (ACLs), and ensuring that network access is segmented appropriately. Cisco ISE’s policy management features help in creating and maintaining these policies, providing a streamlined approach to network security.

Overall, the Wireless and Wired Security NAC project using Cisco ISE provides a robust solution for managing network access and ensuring that security policies are enforced consistently across all types of network connections. The integration of Cisco ISE enhances the organization’s ability to protect sensitive information and maintain a secure network environment.
