The SD-WAN Project aims to enhance network connectivity and resilience by integrating multiple branch locations using FortiGate SD-WAN technology. This initiative is designed to create a more robust and reliable network infrastructure by leveraging various types of network connections, including 4G, leased lines, and broadband. The use of FortiGate SD-WAN ensures a seamless combination of these network types, providing improved bandwidth and reduced latency across the entire network.

One of the key features of this project is the implementation of IPsec security tunnels for broadband and 4G connections. This security measure encrypts data transmitted over these channels, safeguarding it from potential threats and ensuring data integrity. By using IPsec, the project enhances the overall security posture of the network, making it resilient against cyber-attacks and unauthorized access.

To optimize network utilization, the project introduces specific rules for traffic separation within the SD-WAN framework. These rules are designed to prioritize critical applications and balance network traffic efficiently, reducing congestion and ensuring that high-priority applications receive the necessary bandwidth. This approach helps in maintaining optimal performance across different branches, even during peak usage times.

Overall, the SD-WAN Project not only improves connectivity and performance but also introduces a level of flexibility and security that is essential for modern, distributed networks. The integration of various network types and the application of robust security measures make it a comprehensive solution for enhancing organizational network infrastructure.
