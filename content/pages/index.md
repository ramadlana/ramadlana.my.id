      I am a network engineer with nine years of experience and a deep-seated
      passion for continuous learning. Throughout my career, I have navigated
      various technologies to meet evolving business needs, embracing agility in
      a never-ending evolved technology. My strong foundational skills in
      networking, computer systems, and programming have enabled me to quickly
      acquire and master new technologies.


      My experience includes working extensively with networking systems,
      developing monitoring solutions, and building software and automation
      tools using Python, JavaScript, Node.js, and React.js. I have a solid
      understanding of microservices architecture, containerization with Docker,
      and Kubernetes clusters.


      I am also proficient in automation and development tools like Ansible. I
      dedicate significant time to exploring and developing projects with cloud
      technologies, particularly AWS, GCP, and Microsoft Azure. I thrive on
      self-directed research and development, constantly seeking to enhance my
      skills and apply my knowledge to improve my day-to-day work.
